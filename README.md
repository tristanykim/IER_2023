#### 1. Introductory information

Project description:

Physical activity plays a crucial role in promoting a healthy lifestyle, preventing chronic diseases, and enhancing mental well-being and overall quality of life. Daily step counts, measured through wearable activity trackers like Fitbit devices, serve as an objective indicator of physical activity levels and overall activity behavior. In this study, data from three consecutive years (2019, 2020, and 2021) were analyzed to capture the different periods before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

The primary data source for this research was a dataset of Fitbit measurements collected by students from the Clinical Technology faculty at Delft University of Technology. Excel was utilized for data analysis. The study found a significant correlation between the pandemic restrictions and activity behavior, indicating the impact of the pandemic on individuals' physical activity levels. Interestingly, the analysis revealed that factors such as gender, living situation, and attitude towards activity did not contribute to any discrepancies in activity behavior throughout the studied years. These findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between the pandemic and physical activity behavior, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to promote and maintain physical activity during times of disruption

#### 2. Methodological information
This dataset is coming from a study with previous students. The students were asked to track the number of steps taken each day, during one week.
The data was processed in Excel, finding all the averages, performing an ANOVA test and setting up all the graphs.

#### 3. Data specific information
The dataset includes:

- Demographics
  - Sex
  - Living Situation
  - BMI
- Year of data collection (2019-2021)
- Attitude towards physical activity
- Number of steps per day
